        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li><b>inline styles</b> apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Example: 
            (h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide/h1 dont forget to add the "<>")</li>
          <li>This <b>internal style sheet</b> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Example: (<head>
            style
              h1 {
                color: red;
              }
            /style
             /head)
           The preceding CSS states that all h1 elements on the webpage will be red. dont forget the "<>"</li>
          <li><b>External css style sheet</b> is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <link> element placed in the HTML's <head>, as shown in the following code: 
            (head
             link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
            head)</li>
          <li><b>Class attributes</b> allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>In coding parlance, a <b>variable</b> is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code. One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.  </li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the <b>var</b> keyword. for example: <b>var</b> shape = "circle"; In this example, "shape" is the name of our container, or variable, and the data it stores is "circle".
          </li>
          <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. </li>
          <li>the string is contained within quotation marks, ("). All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. </li>
          <li>We can use the console.log() method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. In this case, console.log(topics) will output the value of topics to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
          <li>console.log outputs the value of a variable.</li>
          <li>To understand how to use JavaScript, we first need to understand the concept of control flow. <b>Control flow</b>is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item.  instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values. For example: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an <b>index</b>.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. there are three important statements: <b>starting point for our loop</b>(var x=0). The second statement is the <b>condition</b>(x < shapes.length). We use the <b>length</b> built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code (x++). All together a "for" loop looks like the following: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++)</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
